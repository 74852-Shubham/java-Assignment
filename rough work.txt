JSP-->Advance version of servlet.
server side tech
middle tier tech like servlet.
A static html remains the same ir fixed, in terms of the content it dispays.
dynamic html is the opposite, its content changes on action a user has made on the page before.
(static html+elements that can processed on server)

difference between jsp and sevlet:
jsp allows you to mix static html elemenst that can be processed on server.
in case servlet html can be generated dynamically.
jsp is faster than servlet.

MVC:-model-pojo
view-jsp
controlleer -servlet

MVC Model view controller
Model-->pojo
view-->jsp
controller-servlet

when jsp is requested for first time:-
1.jsp is converted into.java
2.servlet is compiled by a web container.
.class is loaded
instantiating using public no arg constructor.
inialized using init()
thread is created and retrived from threadpool
resquest and response created.
service method get called

fro subsequent request:-
Thread is created and retrived from threadpool
request adn response created.
service method is created.

-->Lifecycle method of jsp::-
public void init(){}
public void _jspService(HttpServelet request,HttpServletResponse response)(){}
public void jsp destroy(){}.

Implicit objects  in jsp::-
implicit object are set of java objects that the JSP Container makes available to-*

implicit objects in JSO::-
->JspWriter->out
httpServletRequest->request
httpserverletResponse->response
HttpSession->session
ServletContect->context
ServletConfig->config
PageContext->PageContext
Object->Page
JSPException -exception.

requestDispatcher rd=request.getRequestDispatcher("forwardedServ");
re.forward(request,response);

RequestDispatcher rd=request.getRequestDispatcher("forwardedSerb);
rd.forward(request,response);

byDefault scope is page
page request session application
setter and getter in jsp
<% ob1.setNum(100);%>
<%=ob1.getNum()%>
if the parameter name of html and datamember name of class is same then 
do not write the no of setProperty again 
but we require to write get property again and again.
here we 
behind every sucessful tag there is a java code.
Attirbite in JSP::-

scope of page is created when we run particualr jsp appln get destroyee

if El dosen't give you expected output write following line inside each jsp page.
<%@pageisELIgnored="false"%>
strMod strob=replaceSpaces;
string str;
str= strob("hello");
